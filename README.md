### Express app :computer:

This is just an curious :grimacing: step towards exploring what express is and this app doesnt really do anything. Just few npm commands and that's pretty much it!

steps:
* npm install -g express
* npm install -g express-generator
* express
* npm run
* npm start

And that's pretty much it. Head over to localhost:3000 or whatever your port is and you must see some messages. Congratulations :tada: Express is up and running :muscle:
